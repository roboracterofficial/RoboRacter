These final projects can be showcased on their personal student profile or Roboracter’s achievement wall—giving them a sense of pride and visibility among peers and parents alike.\\n\\nIn short, our certification isn't just a piece of paper—it’s a meaningful acknowledgment of your child’s hard work, growth, and future potential in the world of technology and robotics.`\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\nconst QnASection = () => {\r\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState([true, false, false, false, false, false, false]);\r\n\r\n  const toggle = idx => {\r\n    setOpen(open => open.map((v, i) => (i === idx ? !v : v)));\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <section className=\"py-16 bg-white relative overflow-hidden\">\r\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 z-0\">\r\n        <img src=\"/Roboracter-q&a-2.jpg\" alt=\"Q&A Background\" className=\"w-full h-full object-cover opacity-30\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 relative z-10\">\r\n        <div className=\"text-center mb-12\">\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-4xl font-bold flex justify-center items-center gap-2\">\r\n            <span className=\"text-blue-500 font-normal\">Roboracter</span>\r\n            <span className=\"text-red-700 font-extrabold\">-FAQ</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <div className=\"flex justify-center items-center mt-2\">\r\n            <span className=\"w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-red-500 rounded-full inline-block mr-1\"></span>\r\n            <span className=\"w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-red-500 rounded-full inline-block mr-1\"></span>\r\n            <span className=\"w-1.5 h-1.5 bg-red-500 rounded-full inline-block mr-2\"></span>\r\n            <span className=\"inline-block align-middle\" style={{width: '90px', height: '4px', background: '#ef4444', borderRadius: '2px'}}></span>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"space-y-4\">\r\n          {qna.map((item, idx) => (\r\n            <div key={idx} className=\"bg-white/50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm cursor-pointer hover:shadow-md transition-shadow\" onClick={() => toggle(idx)}>\r\n              <div className=\"flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-start sm:items-center gap-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"flex-1\">\r\n                  <div className=\"text-black font-bold text-lg mb-4 uppercase tracking-wide\" style={{fontFamily: 'Roboto Slab, serif'}}>{item.question}</div>\r\n                  {open[idx] && (\r\n                    <div className=\"text-black text-2xl leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line\">{item.answer}</div>\r\n                  )}\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"flex-shrink-0 mt-2 sm:mt-0 ml-auto bg-green-100 rounded-full p-2\">\r\n                  <svg\r\n                    className={`w-3.5 h-3.5 text-green-500 transition-transform duration-200 ${open[idx] ?
